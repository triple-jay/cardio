# Cardiovascular Disease Project
## By Jeremy Jung and Andrew Osorio

In this project, we used a cardiovascular disease dataset to train classification models to predict if a patient would have cardiovascular disease, based on the various risk factors and features they had.
We were able to use substantial feature engineering and data manipulation to achieve an accuracy of approximately __73.5%__, which we were able to achieve with a voting classifier using our three best models.

We used the following classification models:
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* Perceptron
* Linear SVC
* Random Forest

Through our data visualizations, we found that the most important factors for cardiovascular disease were cholesterol, blood pressure levels, and age.
